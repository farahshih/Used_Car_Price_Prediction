# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
Final Project for Data Analytics Course at UC Berkeley

#### Idea and Motivation
Our project focuses on the used car market in Germany. We act as a used car dealer in Germany and analyze the most recent data on ebay to do a basic analysis on used car price and factors that have significant influence on it. Overall, we hope this analysis can help us to make a better assessment on used car prices when we buy and sell used cars.
